part 1 : getting things started

    Create a div in the HTML file. This div will be the main container for the grid.

            x create a single div in the body.
            x make its ID grid-container.

        !!!!Do not create any other divs within this container.

    create divs through javaScript DOM manipulation.

        each div should be created by a for loop.
        The function should take in a certain amount of grid squares.
        two four loops should iterate through the 16 squares as the project
        first goal should be 16x16
            it could also be that we create 32 boxes then flex them into rows.

    !!!There should be 16 div boxes within the main DIV container.

        These containers should be manipulated by flexbox to conform to columns and rows.

        flex should grow to stay within a certain amount of space for the main box.
        likely the flexbox will need to support 64 boxes before wrapping to the next row.

    When mousing over elements the individual divs should change colors and leave a trail of
    where the mouse has been.

        the javascript should have some sort of mouse over listener. When the element has the event, javascript should trigger it to add a different css styling that changes its color.

        however, I am not clear on how to create a trail from the mouse curser as it passes
        through the div. It is possible that the divs are small enough already that they are the things changing from a white background to a black one.
